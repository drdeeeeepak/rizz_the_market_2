## G. Conflict weighting — "don't enter a move that won't materialise"

Five independent **pillars** each vote bull (+1) / bear (−1) / neutral (0):
*Price vs VWAP · Momentum (RSI) · Volume (CVD) · Breadth · Structure (higher/lower lows)*
(plus *Dealer gamma* as a today-only sixth pillar in the live verdict).
```
confidence = agree / (agree + oppose) × 100
conflict   = (2 or more pillars fighting the price direction)
```
- The **Signal-agreement %** (purple dotted line + the top metric card) is this number.
- The **scorecard** shows each pillar as ✅ agrees / ❌ fights / • flat.
- **Continuation calls (UPTREND ★ / DOWNTREND ▼) are withheld when conflicted** — a
  conflicted tape is exactly the move that chops and fails. (Exhaustion turns — ▲
  brewing, ▽ topping — are *allowed* to fire against the move; that's their job.)
- When conflicted with no clean turn, the verdict becomes **`MIXED — STAND ASIDE`**.

*(Table cols: `P` `M` `V` `B` `S` votes, `Agree`, `Oppose`, `Conf%`.)*

## H. The metric cards (under the headline)

| Card | Value |
|---|---|
| **BULL READ** | `bull_read` 0–100 (Part 2b §F) |
| **BEAR READ** | `bear_read` 0–100 (Part 2b §F) |
| **GAMMA FLIP LINE** | the flip price + spot's distance from it (Part 3 §B) |
| **SIGNAL AGREEMENT** | `confidence` % + how many pillars agree vs fight (§G) |

## I. 🔬 Behind the scenes — every calculation, candle by candle

A collapsible table under the chart, **one row per candle, newest first**, re-exposing
the columns above so you can audit exactly why a marker did or did not fire. Nothing new
is computed — it just makes every number visible.

**Column key** — the **results lead**, then the inputs that produced them, raw price last:

`Time` · **`State`** (the resulting call) · **`Net`** (bull-read − bear-read, the single
directional conviction — 🟢 + stay / 🔴 − defend, heat-shaded) · **`Brd%`** (breadth — 🟢
>55 broad / 🔴 <45 weak) · **`Conf%`** (signal agreement, tinted 🟢 when the prevailing
lean is bullish / 🔴 when bearish, darker = stronger) · `ΔVWAP` (close − fair value) ·
`RSI` (banded: 🟣 capitulation <30 · 🔴 downtrend 30–45 · ⚪ neutral 45–55 · 🟢 uptrend
55–70 · 🟠 overbought >70) · `RSIdiv` (🟢▲ bull / 🔴▼ bear RSI divergence) · `CVD↑` (🟢▲
CVD rose vs the *previous* candle) · `CVDdiv` (🟢▲ bull / 🔴▼ bear 6-bar volume divergence)
· `Hi` `Lo` (swing-high / swing-low direction — 🟢▲ higher / 🔴▼ lower; read as a pair:
▲▲ uptrend, ▼▼ downtrend, ▲▼ expanding, ▼▲ inside) · `LWick` (🟢 bullish lower side — long
lower wick *or* green body with no lower wick) `UWick` (🔴 bearish upper side — long upper
wick *or* red body with no upper wick) · `Candle` (single close-location read: 🟢 +1 closed
at high / 🔴 −1 at low — momentum *and* rejection in one column; on trial alongside the
two-column LWick/UWick split) · `%B` (momentum **gated by fast structure** + reversal: high
%B *with* a new high → 🟢 up-momentum / pale if no new high; low %B with a new low → 🔴;
stretched beyond a band but no new extreme → 🟠 amber reversal-watch; ~0.5 grey) ·
**`Reversal` `Uptrend`** (🟢 bull pair) · **`Downtr` `Topping`** (🔴 bear pair) ·
`Stretch` (signed — 🟢 + above fair value / 🔴 − below) · `Persist`
(↑3 🟢 above / ↓3 🔴 below VWAP) · `P/M/V/B/S` pillar votes (▲/▼/·) · `Agree` `Oppose` ·
*then at the end:* `Open` `High` `Low` `Close` `VWAP` `CVD`.

**Reading it:** the four score columns and `Net` are **heat-shaded** (darker = louder),
so scan a row to see which side is winning and how strongly; the arrow columns are
coloured 🟢 green (up / bull) / 🔴 red (down / bear); `RSI` is banded by regime; the
`State` text colour matches the ▲★▼▽ chart marks; a fired marker should line up with its
score crossing 55/60 in the reads panel and the pillar votes agreeing.
